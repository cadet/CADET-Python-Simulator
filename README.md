# CADET-Python-Simulator

This is a prototype to solve systems of unit operations in Python.
This project is currently not meant to be released as a fully-featured alternative to the much more faster / better / stronger CADET-Core (or even CADET-Julia).
Its purpose is simply to have something to play around with in Python s.t. we can easily explore potential extensions or modifications of the internal structure of CADET (e.g. how to implement pressure, how to treat viscosities etc.).
